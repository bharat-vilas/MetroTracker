# Map Component Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Polyline Persistence Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Polylines were appearing and disappearing when routes were selected/deselected
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced `clearMapElements()` with more selective `clearRouteElements()`
  - Polylines now update instead of being completely cleared and redrawn
  - Vehicle markers are kept separate from route elements

### 2. **Stop Markers** ✅
- **Problem**: No markers shown for bus stops along routes
- **Solution**:
  - Added automatic fetching of stop data for each route
  - Stop markers are now displayed for every stop along polyline routes
  - Different styling for first/last stops vs regular stops
  - Color-coded to match the route polyline color
  - Detailed popup information for each stop including ETA

### 3. **Vehicle Icon Display** ✅
- **Problem**: Vehicle icons needed to be more visible and persistent
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced vehicle icons with bus emoji and gradient styling
  - Different animation for moving vs stationary vehicles
  - Persistent tracking every 3 seconds
  - Smooth position transitions with easing animation
  - Vehicle markers are preserved when route selections change

## Key Features Added

### Enhanced Stop Markers
- **Regular stops**: Small circular markers matching route color
- **Terminal stops**: Larger markers with special styling and pulsing animation
- **Informative popups**: Show stop name, route, position, and ETA

### Improved Vehicle Tracking
- **Visual design**: Orange gradient with bus emoji for better visibility
- **Animations**: Pulsing effect for moving vehicles
- **Persistence**: Vehicles remain visible when route selections change
- **Smooth transitions**: 2-second animated movement between positions
- **Real-time updates**: Refreshed every 3 seconds

### Better Route Management
- **Selective clearing**: Only clear specific elements when needed
- **Parallel operations**: Fetch stop data for multiple routes simultaneously
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks if stop data is unavailable

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Route elements are managed separately from vehicle markers
const routeLinesRef = useRef<L.Polyline[]>([]);     // Polylines
const markersRef = useRef<L.Marker[]>([]);          // Stop markers  
const vehicleMarkersRef = useRef(new Map<string, L.Marker>>()); // Vehicle markers
```

### Key Functions
- `clearRouteElements()`: Selectively clear polylines and/or stops
- `drawPolylinesFromGeoJSON()`: Enhanced to fetch and display stops
- `updateVehicleMarkers()`: Smooth vehicle position updates
- `createStopMarker()`: Enhanced stop marker with different styles
- `createVehicleIcon()`: Improved vehicle icon with animations

## Usage

1. **Route Selection**: Check/uncheck routes in the sidebar
2. **Stop Information**: Click on any stop marker to see details
3. **Vehicle Tracking**: Vehicles update automatically and smoothly
4. **Route Information**: Click on polylines to see route details

The map now provides a comprehensive view with:
- ✅ Persistent polylines that don't disappear
- ✅ All bus stops marked and color-coded
- ✅ Real-time vehicle tracking with smooth animations
- ✅ Detailed information popups for stops and routes
